The Text component is simply for adding paragraphs of text, it is constructed by typing some text (in an avaialbe command line) followed by a semi-colon (;). However the entered text may not contain any of the operators or constructors (i shall call these escape chars) that are used for other components, so a list of these is kept in the constructor enabling a user to enter them by putting a back-slash (\) before them. Although no ``escape chars'' can be used when originally constructing a text element, once the component is a text component, anything may be written in it (as in a normal word-processor). The text component has a popup (eg. when right-clicked) that alllows the font to be changed (ie font face, size, colour and attributes such as bold or italics).
