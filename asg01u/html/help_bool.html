Boolean Expressions
<BR>
<BR>
</b>
The Boolean Expression components are all expressions that have a boolean value when evaluated. 		
<BR>
<b>Standard Boolean Expressions</b>
<BR>
The Standard Boolean Expression components all take other boolean expressions (including the comparison boolean expressions) as there arguments, those currently available are and (\&), or (|), not (!), and the booleans true, and false. These expressions can be constructed, and then edited in much the same way as the numerical expressions above. (including the use of brackets)
<BR>
<b>Comparison Boolean Expressions</b>
<BR>
What i have called comparison boolen expressions are boolean expressions themselves, but whose arguments are numerical expressions. The boolean value of these expressions depends on some sort of comparison between the two numerical expressions. The available operators are currently equals (=), not equals (!=), greater than (>), less than (<), at least (>=), and at most (<=). These expressions are also created and edited in much the same way as the other types of expression above.
